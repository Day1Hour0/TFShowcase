There are currently 5 files in the first upload, these are 

* 2ImageBinary - Using Convolution to classify between cat and dog, use as a framework for binary image classification 

* 2MuliImage   - Using Convolution to classify the sign language(convert hand sign to alphabet), use as a framework for multiple class classification

* 3WordPrediction - Using Cell state and Convolution to process a text piece. Then predict the next word. Use for framework for Word processor

* 3WordProcessor - Using Cell state and Convolution to process text. Then based create vector of the word (happy, sad for example)

* 4TimeNSeries - Framework for creating a Timeseries for testing. RNN model, and graphing function for future time series usage
